## Project Description 
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly important as more people look for ways to help the environment and cut down on pollution. They're leading the change by providing a cleaner way to travel that doesn't rely on more polluting energy like gasoline. EVs are here to stay; they're a key element in moving us towards a future where we can breathe easier and the planet is healthier. Additionally, with technological advancements, EVs are becoming more accessible and efficient, offering longer ranges and shorter charging times.

The main goal of this project is to look into two big questions about EVs in France. First, we want to understand how French consumers are reacting to the push for more EVs and what new buying patterns are showing. We'll look at how many people are buying EVs, if companies and governments are using more of them, and how government initiatives are helping this along. Second, we'll see if Franceâ€™s infrastructure is getting ready for more EVs by enabling the necessary amount of charging points. This will give us a clearer picture of how ready France is for more electric cars on the roads.

## Project Plan
- Scope definition 
- End-to-end project planning using Trello
- Data collection using these following sources (Web Scraping, API, Flat File, Database & Big Data System)
- Exploratory data analysis in Python (data wrangling, data cleaning & data visualization)
- Selection and creation of a database using MySQL
- Added data to database and designed Entity Relationship Diagram
- Explored data with MySQL
- Exposed data via API
- Data visualization of main insights using Tableau
- Process data for time series analysis
- Train and test models


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following EDA steps were followed:
1. Verification of data collection.
Confirming the sources' credibility, ensuring data consistency (format, scale), and performing a preliminary assessment (looking for empty fields, duplicates, data types, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning.
Making sense of missing values (deciding the best way to handle them), correcting data inconsistencies (standardize categories, correct typos, and ensure consistent formatting). Finally, decide how to deal with outliers, whether to remove them or keep them, based on the context.
3. Data Visualization.
Historical data was analysed and compared (To continue)
