## Project Description 

## Project Process


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following EDA steps were followed:
1. Verification of data collection.
Confirming the sources' credibility, ensuring data consistency (format, scale), and performing a preliminary assessment (looking for empty fields, duplicates, data types, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning.
Making sense of missing values (deciding the best way to handle them), correcting data inconsistencies (standardize categories, correct typos, and ensure consistent formatting). Finally, decide how to deal with outliers, whether to remove them or keep them, based on the context.
3. Data Visualization.
Historical data was analysed and compared (To continue)
