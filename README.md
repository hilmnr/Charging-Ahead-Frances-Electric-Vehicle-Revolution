## Project Description 

## Project Process


## Exploratory Data Analysis
The following EDA steps were followed:
1. Data Collection Verification
Understanding the sources, checking for consistency (format, scale) and doing a preliminary assessment(looking for obvious issues with empty fields, duplicates, data types, etc).
2. Data Cleaning:
Making sense of missing values (deciding the best way to handle them), correcting data inconsistencies(standardize categories, correct typos, and ensure consistent formatting).Finally, decide how to deal with outliers, whether to remove them or keep them, based on the context.




firstly, the historical data were analysed and compared
secondly, the results of Time Series with the forecast for 2023-2024 were analysed.
The appropriate graphs were prepared on Tableau and plotly.
